# Build a 55 + 5 Clock

A web application that implements the pomodoro timer. It is built with React, JavaScript, and CSS/HTML. It's the [last project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) for the front end libraries certification (freecodecamp.org).

I've taken some liberties from the original brief. Tomatito = small tomato in Spanish and pomodoro is tomato in Italian.
